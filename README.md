# Kotlin DTO Workbench

This project aims to try out some architecture to deal with multiple
layers in a Kotlin service application.

It is in part inspired by an article from [Jasper Sprengers: CRUD operations on Spring REST resources with Kotlin](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/04/crud-operations-spring-rest-resources-kotlin/).
